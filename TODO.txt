1 > PRELIMINARY ANALISYS

    BRIEF DESCRIPTION                                                                                                          """"" ELIA """""
        a. (Practical_01) | what type of documents does it contain?
        b. (Practical_01) | how many documents are there?
        c. (Practical_01) | calculate and visualise some simple statistics for the collection, e.g. the average document length, the average vocabulary size, etc.

        Comments:   -1a e 1b sono già fatti bene nel paper, basta farla riassumere a chatGPT e controllarli, ci vuole niente
                    -per 1c ho già scritto due righe di codice, non è niente di chè. Devo solo fare qualche grafico

    PLAY AROUND: for example
        d. (Practical_04) | cluster the documents and visualise the clusters to see what types of groups are present            """"" ELIA SE AVANZA TEMPO """""
                            (or whether the known classes can be found);
        e. (Practical 03) | index the documents so that you can perform keyword search over them;                               !!!!!! RIMOSSO !!!!!!!
        f. (Practical_05) | train a Word2Vec embedding on the data and investigate the properties of the resulting embedding    """"" ENRICO """""
        x.                | post-taggin                                                                                         """"" MICHEAL """""

2 > TRAINING MODELS

        g. train a model to perform that task (by fine-tuning models on the training data);
        h. test pre-trained models on the task (if they already exist); and
        i. evaluate different models and compare their performance.
        
        HINT: as a minimum here we would expect to see 
                - linear classifier trained on the data (if an appropriate for the task) 
                - deep learning model, such as BERT
              compared.

3 > POSSIBLE EXTENSION

    Depending on the dataset chosen there will be many additional investigations you can perform. For
    instance, oftentimes we can improve performance of a model on a particular task by simply including
    additional data that is related to the task in its training set. So see if you can find other data that helps
    with the task that you chose.
